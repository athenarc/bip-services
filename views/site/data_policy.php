    <h3>Other Information we collect, store and record</h3>

    <p><ul>
        <li><b>User-input data:</b> these we use to record search sessions and other visits, as well as for supporting readings functionality (including reading levels, tags, and notes). 
        This is information we store in our own servers for the duration of the provision of the service to a registered user.</li>
        <li><b>Scholar ORCiD data:</b> we store ORCiD data (such name and ORCiD ID) in our own servers as long as a user's BIP! Scholar profile is linked with their ORCiD account.
        Furthermore, we collect, process on-the-fly, and display privately in our UI the user’s public information in their ORCiD account to support the functionality of BIP! Scholar (albeit without storing anything). Moreover, we publish the same information through our UI and API in case the user has selected to make their BIP! Scholar profile public.</li>
    </ul></p>
